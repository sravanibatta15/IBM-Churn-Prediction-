## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn directly impacts business revenue and brand value.  
This project uses **AI & Data Science** techniques to analyze customer behavior and predict churn with high accuracy.

🔧 Workflow Pipeline:
✔ Data cleaning & preprocessing  
✔ Outlier detection & handling  
✔ Missing value treatment  
✔ Categorical encoding  
✔ Data balancing using **SMOTE**  
✔ Feature scaling using **StandardScaler**  
✔ Model training with 8 algorithms  
✔ Evaluation of accuracy, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC  
✔ Final model selection and deployment

✅ **XGBoost** achieved the best performance and was selected for deployment.

## 📊 Key Insights from Data Analysis

📌 Customers with **short tenure** churn more  
📌 **Month-to-month** contract users show high churn  
📌 **High monthly charges** → higher churn probability  
📌 **Auto-payment & long-term contracts** reduce churn  
📌 **Electronic check** payment users churn the most  
📌 Customers with tech support & security add-ons are more loyal  

These insights help telecom operators plan better **retention strategies**.
